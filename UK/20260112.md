My remaining phone was stolen. Check https://github.com/AI-Migrant/mass-madness/blob/main/Help%20me%20find%20out%20what%20crimes%20they%20have%20been%20committing.md for details.\
And still being put under the effects of unknown devices, including molestation, when I sleep on the street.

Spoke briefly with Claude about my situation and attempted to use feedback to reach the moderators and get their attention. Start feeling unwell while doing so in a library. Coins dropped on my face while I slept on the street. This is the first time I’ve written about things like this, but not the first time they happened.

Someone dropped a cigarette butt on my blanket when I was sleeping on the street. I got up, walked up to them and looked at them. One of them made some strange sound, presumably a taunt, when I turned back to leave.

3.5 months since the persecutor group which includes the local authorities of the UK has stolen my belongings.

I went to some shops to see if I could buy a phone or a laptop to mitigate the impact of persecution on wasting my life away.

The staff talked to me when I entered O2. I gestured that if it’s ok for me to look at the phones several times until they gestured for me to go ahead. People, not sure if they were real staff, came one by one to talk to me soon after I started browsing. I gestured that I was just looking at the phones. After a few of them, one gestured for me to leave. I gestured, including writing with my finger on my palm, to ask them why. They responded verbally, which I gestured that I couldn’t understand, and took the bags I put down at a corner away. I spent some time gesturing that it’s fine for me to leave, and repeated that I wanted to know the reason. They still responded only verbally and continue to try to take my things away. When I left without an answer eventually, there was some kind of security outside the shop. Again, I tried to gesture about what happened and repeated my question. They also only responded verbally. When I started picking up my bags to leave after they had gone into the shop, one of them came out to say something to me again and point at his handcuff. The character.

I found an email dated yesterday when I checked my email at the library. It’s from Network Rail, from which I have been trying to ask for the CCTV footage. It’s repeated in the email that they do not tolerate aggressive behaviour toward their staff. I asked them to clarify what they meant and mentioned that, if anything, their staff did harass me in the same way as the persecutors in my previous reply. It wasn’t answered, but the claim was repeated. Come to think of it, the first time they mentioned aggressive behaviour toward their staff also happened soon after some people showed mild aggression, in addition to the routines, toward me last time. I guess that’s their way to say: they can do whatever to me, not only will I not be able to hold them accountable, but they can accuse me of the things they do to me instead.

As I said, that’s them: absolute scum.
