I have been editing the repository github.com/AI-Migrant/mass-madness for the past few days. The blanket I used for sleeping on the street was stolen when I went to the toilet this early morning. As I have mentioned before, I am basically arranged to live on the street by the persecutors, so the blanket given to me by one of the charities was probably also arranged or agreed by the persecutors. But if we trace things back, I wouldn’t be living on the street if they hadn’t stolen my belongings in the first place. Or, looking even further back, many other things wouldn’t have happened if they hadn’t persecuted me. Let’s just focus on the recent situation here:
- They stole my belongings, highly limiting what I can do and painting me as a beggar to humiliate and discredit.
- They are arranging to keep me living on the street, with limited access to many things.
- If I don’t do as they please. They steal again to make me more miserable.

How many times have they sent thieves already? I reported to them the first two times, but neither time did they show the CCTV footage. You can read about what has been happening this whole time from my entries.

Went to an EE store. They told me all the products were out of stock.*
