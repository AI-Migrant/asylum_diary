I am sorry if you are not the actual church I am trying to contact. I hope at least one of the email address is correct.

Hello, I am the person in red who used the toilet for quite a while this morning.

I am writing in all seriousness about the persecution I am facing.

I would like to clarify the matter further. I will quote what I typed to show some of the staff this morning.

This email ended up quite long. It's hard to explain even just part of the years-long persecution.

I would like to add in advance that when I mentioned diarrhoea, it's not necessarily the staff of the charities being the one who drugged the food. I think that there is a good chance that the authorities who mixed into the staff did it. They have drugged me a lot of times since Lithuania, or even before that, for more than just diarrhoea. Although to be honest, I also don't root out the involvement of the charities, with the authorities convincing you to.

I am also inclined to believe that the authorities were the ones who wanted to break into the toilet I was using by force. I don't want to think that normal human would do such a thing. A simple thing to consider: What would be the state of people in toilet? I gave responses although I couldn't speak, but they still opened the door and tried to enter. Don't say that I only think of them the worst way. I won't be too surprised that they even monitored me in your toilet and knew that I almost finished cleaning up when they broke in. But still, was it appropriate?

Let's think the matter over, you can find references on github.com/c-cm/cnp or github.com/locharp/asylum_diary:
1. they treated me as non-human when I tried to be the best person and they still do.
2. what they have been doing include many serious crimes. E.g.: theft, permanent health damages, drugging, molestation, assault, unlawful arrest, false accusation
3. they doubled down when I asked them to stop
4. they continue across countries even after I left
5. they do it proudly but get mad when I sing about their deeds
6. they stole my belongings to force me live on the street get food and support from charities like you
7. they are not happy that I actually get food and support from charities
8. they continue to create problems at the charities
9. they still molest me after making me live on the street 
10. they drugged me again to cause me have a diarrhoea
11. they acted mad and tried to break into the toilet

This is not even everything that they have done.
Doesn't it make you think?
Do you think that they are solving problems instead of creating?

They probably have different narratives to convince you. I can only hope that you can read my online diary and see for yourselves. It's not a complete record, but it should help understanding what happened.

I fully aware, since the beginning when I applied for asylum in Lithuanian to now, that I am asking for help as a refugee. They sent people to tell me to complain since the beginning. I didn't until more than 1 year later when they had already committed many crimes, hurt me in many ways.

And by complain I mean I questioned them directly, as opposite to contact other organization. At least for the beginning.

---(quote 1, corrected some spelling and grammar mistakes)

I am very sorry to have used the toilet for so long. Would you let me tell you the reason, it's not like I wanted to.

I will go, but I want to clarify what happened.

I have been having diarrhoea since I wrote a new article about the persecution I am facing yesterday. Whether it's coincidence or not, you can make your own judgement. But that's why I was in the toilet for so long.

Thanks for still offering food. Anything that doesn't cause the same thing as I have written would be appreciated.

I am sad that you are so mad even though I tried to tell you what happened.

I understand what that act meant. I was trying to emphasise the problem I really faced, not accusing you. I didn't have a meal here yesterday. Want to check the underwear that were in a mess which I washed in the toilet?

I am not asking you to give me new underwear. I am telling you what I said really happened.

I am leaving now. Just want to say one last thing about this whole thing.

Where do you think was one of the pair of underwear before I washed it? Does it explain why I was in the toilet for a long time?

I am not asking for anything, just clarifying.

---(end quote 1)

I don’t write often, considering my situation, but I wrote something yesterday. Below I will quote one of them. The other was written physically and its content was about instead of direct help I hope that the reader could find out the other crimes the persecutors committed. And that I assure the readers that I had the interests of the host countries in mind and appreciated even the smallest things.

I can’t show it here since it’s physical, but I would like to add something to it nonetheless.

I cannot find out their other crimes because as you can see I am being monitored, stalked everywhere and my communications can be intercepted, and most importantly the influence of the persecutors is too huge. 

---(quote 2 - https://github.com/locharp/asylum_diary/edit/main/UK/20251125.md)

Civil societies die so easily that it's like dominoes.

Wherever I go, every person, every organisation has decided what to say and what to do before I even arrive.

Of course, I know the authorities can always tell them something and have them act the way they instruct. With the extreme surveillance, they can also see where I am going and arrive before I do.

The disappointment, however, has gone from collusion between governments to mass madness, from bad institutions to general loss of values among people. The horror of the latter is far worse than the former in my opinion.

I know I have talked about this long ago. But I guess it still pushes me towards deeper despair every day.

If the people who took side with the persecutors before were just acting on a single occasion, the people now are doing it long term.

I have tried to evoke what I believed to be in the brighter side of human nature. I have always been harsh while looking at human as a whole. Yet, all the grim impressions and views I have can't protect me from disappointment that turns into despair.

Since my persecutors have gone so far that they unlawfully arrested me and falsely accuse me, I should add that I have always been nice to people in contrast to my pessimistic views for human as a whole. The persecutors know and exploit it time and again in disgusting ways. In fact, I will say that the fact I was nice to everyone was a reason why their “baby, hehehe” mentality has gone insane. And sadly, the people joining them are probably the same.
I can understand that as the first response while being told a narrative by the authorities. But it is far more than that. It has been months since the persecutors stole my belongings and made me live on the street. I have been forced to live on the food and materials from charities.
People might think that “we are just doing it this particular occasion”. But does it work simple that way?
Back in Lithuania I already said things would only get worse because of their mentality. Look at the situation today, was I wrong? I am not even smart with people, but people will hate those they have hurt, and conformity gets people to join in something they shouldn't. The authorities being part of the persecutor group only makes it worse. A group with powers to abuse and enjoy impunity will likely snowball into something bigger. Tendencies like these turned out to be reality, haven’t they?

I haven't received a reply yet. I won't be too surprised if I don't receive one. Which is in line with the what I experienced in the past years. 

In any case, I would like to add something I forgot to mention in my last email.
1. I heard laughter when they tried to break into the toilet.
2. The act mentioned in the quote referred to the script they acted out upstairs after I was told to leave the basement, which I believe was pretending to complain about the food—some toast, which was the same as what I was given. Acts like that continued for years. The reason is not known to me. Those were clearly not my behaviours, but then what's the point of them continuing such nonsense for years? It might be worth thinking about for me, as well as for you.

I hope you, as well as other people, could look closer at what this event reveal. Why and how all that I mentioned could have happened in the modern age of 2025? If what you have see and what I have mentioned don't seem off enough, please read my online diary at github.com/locharp/asylum_diary and know that even with all the entries there, the record is not complete.

Good afternoon,

I'm sorry not to reply sooner, as I had to make some enquiries.

I now understand that the incident you described involved the Wednesday Breakfast Club, which is run by the companions of Malta. 

I have copied Helena Letman, who is in charge of the club, into this email, so that she can respond to you.

Best wishes,

Fr **

Hello, I would like to confirm one thing with you.

Was the person who shouted at me after I came out of the toilet last Wednesday a genuine regular staff member who worked there at breakfast time? 

As I have mentioned in previous emails. I know the influence and power of my persecutors allow them to be everywhere.

I would like to have another breakfast in your basement this coming Wednesday if you agree.

Dear **,

 

Thank you for your email of yesterday (1 December, timed at 13.20hrs) which was addressed to Fr. ** at Golden Square.  Your email was subsequently forwarded to me, as the Safeguarding Officer of ***, and also to ******, the Chairman of ******.  As you know, the *** run the breakfast club at Golden Square which I understand you attended last Wednesday (26 November).  I have copied Fr. ** and Mr ** on this reply email.

 

I have received a full report of the events at the breakfast club last Wednesday and can confirm, in response to the question you raised in your email of 1 December, that the people who knocked on the door of the WC which you were occupying at the breakfast club on 26 November, and who were then involved in the exchanges with you that followed, are all regular volunteers with ****** at our breakfast club in Golden Square.

 

I would also like to reassure you that none of the volunteers intended to cause you any upset or distress last Wednesday morning. The volunteers involved were simply, in the interests of yourself and others, trying to address the situation caused by the fact that you had spent a long time in the WC; albeit we appreciate that this appears to have resulted from you being unwell. Further, whilst their description of the incident does not accord with yours and we do not accept your criticism of their handling of it, we do very much regret any upset or distress that you may have suffered.  We also hope that you have fully recovered from any illness that you had last week, and that you are now feeling much better.

 

We are pleased to note that you would like to join us again at Golden Square, and I can confirm that you are of course welcome to attend the breakfast club. If I may, I would however like to take this opportunity to remind you of our rules of good conduct and behaviour and the need to follow any requests and instructions issued by our team.  May I also remind you that we only allow each guest approximately 10 minutes in the shower and bathroom, in order to ensure that all guests who wish to take a shower may do so. Please note that we also make it a rule for guests and volunteers alike, that if someone is not feeling well or has symptoms of any kind on the day, they should not attend until they are recovered.

 

Assuring you of our best intentions.

 

Yours,

**

Safeguarding Officer for ******

Allow me to include the email addresses that seem to belong to the staff members there. The years-long persecution causes me to worry about where and whether I will reach or not.

I would like to clarify that so far, I have been inclined to believe the radical behaviours stemmed from the authorities mostly, and haven’t criticised the staff member.

From what I know, persecutors and authorities like stirring up discord among people. I can tell for sure that my persecutors do. I would try not to fall for it, although the number of people joining the persecution makes me wonder if my restraint is meaningful. Their status and influence persuade people, I guess.

Could you clarify in which ways our descriptions differ, please? It would be helpful to understand the specific differences between our descriptions.

I am copying the previous emails for better tracking.
